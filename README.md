# nlouis56 VsCode Theme
## This is the README for my Visual Studio color theme!

Hi! This is my personnal color theme for visual studio, it is loosely inspired from the "sonicradish" theme on ZSH.
Feel free to hit me up if you'd like to contribute to this theme, you can reuse it however you want, as long as you don't try to sell it or something, it's free and it will always be!

co-developp√© avec Claire :)
**Enjoy!**
